# ***Crowdfunding ETL***

## Overview and Purpose of Project

In this project, we are working for the company Independent Funding. We are asked to transform the data given in one CSV into separate CSV files by applying the proccess of Extract-Transform-Load Data with the intent of facilitating the analysis that has been asked to perform. With PostgreSQL as well as SQL, we will be able to run the analysis and create queries that generate reports for stakeholders. 

The purpose of this project is to use the improved separate CSV files, and an additional file containing information about the brackers, to retrieve additional information about them. These two new tables will provide well-rounded list of information about the brackers, and the companies they are associated with. In these tables, we are also inculding how much each company needs to raise to get to their goal, and by providing the names of the brackers that have supported them before, they have a higher chance of getting to their original goal faster.
